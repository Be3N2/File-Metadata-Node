# File-Metadata-Node

Can upload a file and submit to recieve a json object back containing the size in bytes.

Ex: {"name": "largePhoto.JPG", "size": 1663142}

It is running over on glitch so you can go try out the program there: https://size-of-file.glitch.me/

Used multer to manage the uploaded files. Very helpful, you can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer

This project was made for freecodecamp and helped me learn how to manage uploaded files to a node server.
